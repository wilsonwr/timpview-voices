We aren't tracking down heroes, celebrities, or subject-matter experts; we simply want to connect with our neighbors. Everyday conversations can unearth extraordinary stories and friendships. In that spirit, we aim for comfortable, lighthearted conversations with the fun neighbors that we used to interact with regularly. The only criteria for being our guest is that you are somehow affiliated with the Timpview neighborhood of Orem. You don't have to currently live within the boundaries of the neighborhood. The boundaries can be seen below: Nominate a neighbor Like C.S. Lewis, we believe that there are no ordinary people . So nominate a neighbor as our guest! Many remarkable people do not think they are worth highlighting when they really are. Let us know about those people, and we will get in touch with them. What to Expect as a Guest We will send the guest an invitation by email that explains the purpose of the podcast. They will receive a link to an online calendaring website, where they can schedule a virtual meeting time. The guest needs: A basic working microphone Zoom software installed on a computer or mobile phone We don\u2019t take ourselves too seriously; we haven\u2019t bought expensive recording hardware or post-processing software. We expect the podcast to only circulate within this neighborhood. For each episode, we use Zoom to record a 15 to 30 minute conversation. We are currently posting audio recordings only, but we may consider video in the future. We are happy to do some basic editing to help the guest sound as good as possible. If wanted, we can provide a list of general questions ahead of time.","title":"Suggest a Guest"},{"location":"contact/#suggest-a-guest","text":"Contact Us timpviewvoices[at]gmail.com","title":"Suggest a Guest"},{"location":"contact/#join-us","text":"Our goal is community .

As her father was in the Royal Air Force (RAF) she moved a lot, living in various places in England, Scotland and Wales as well as Gibraltar. As an adult, she spent a year working for a Swiss travel agent in Lugano, Switzerland. After joining the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, she came to BYU and completed a BA in English and a MA in rhetoric. She worked at BYU for 29 years and, after her MA, taught first-year writing part-time, keeping her day job of administrative assistant in Undergraduate Education (GE and Honors programs). She likes to garden and by default has created an English garden in hot-weather Utah; cook food from various countries, especially European and Indian; has hosted dancers from the Springville Folk Festival and had several exchange students to give her children exposure to other cultures; and likes to travel visiting many countries in Europe (bicycling around the Netherlands and Denmark were two memorable holidays). She likes doing family history. Currently her main activity is writing historical fiction which means going down rabbit-holes of research, meeting with critique groups, and attending writing conferences and, once in a while, self-publishing a book. Karen has lived in the Timpview neighborhood for 41 years. She is a widow of 28 years and has four children and six grandchildren who live in Virginia, Washington state, and Utah. She and her husband, Peter, enjoyed raising their children here and receiving the support and love of neighbors through good times and bad. It\u2019s a wonderful place to live because of the kind, caring people who live here.
