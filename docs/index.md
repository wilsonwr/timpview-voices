## :sparkling_heart: Why We Exist

Isolation and loneliness are at all-time highs due to COVID-19. The Timpview Voices podcast was created to continue strengthening friendships in the Timpview neighborhood of Orem. We highlight the fun and interesting things about our neighbors who sit in as guests, whether it be their hobbies, their life experiences, or simply their fun personalities.

The boundaries of the Timpview neighborhood extend west-to-east from Geneva Road to State Street, and north-south from roughly 1200-1400 North to 800 North. A map of the neighborhood is below:
